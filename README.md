o3-base
=======
This project seeks to replace o2-base as an easy python base to build IRC bots
on. It is not related to the failed oonbotti3 project, but is rather based on
the IRC bot framework of HynneFlip.

Setup
=====
Copy `bot.conf.example` to `bot.conf` and run `python3 ircbot.py` to bring up
the bot skeleton, which can be used as a very quick and dirty IRC client. User
code goes in `botcmd.py`.
